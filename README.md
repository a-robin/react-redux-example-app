Example app made from the Pluralsight's class by Cory House "Building apps with React and Redux in ES6". scaffolded with a slightly tweaked version by me [Tweaked boilerplate template](https://github.com/a-robin/create-react-app) of the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

As I found the AirBnb eslint template quite constraining while learning js, i will activate it in this project to enforce more functional and stateless approach with Redux and ES6.
